# Muzammil Portfolio (Vite + React)

This is a ready-to-run Vite + React portfolio project created for Muzammil.

## How to run

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Run dev server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Notes
- The Weather app uses a demo fallback unless you add an OpenWeather API key inside `src/App.jsx` (search for `API_KEY`).
- Images are loaded from Unsplash for demo purposes. Replace with your local files under `public/assets/` if you want.
